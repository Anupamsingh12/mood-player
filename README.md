# mood-player
Here is the basic under development model of an Emotion based media player developed on python3 
all you need is to install the complete files in same directory and you can customize it with your own model
and dependencies you should need to install are:-
1. os 
2.keras
3.tensorflow
4.opencv 
5.pYgame


here We have used tkinter for our interface design..since it was a basic one 
however the accuracy is not too much since our training dataset image was small..
but can be incresed and made more accurate

keep the files as it is 
create one model folder and place your own trainned model inside the directory
and run final.py 

Thank you
